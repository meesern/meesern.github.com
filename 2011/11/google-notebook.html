      Replacing Google Notebook 
      <time class="updated" pubdate>Nov 10 2011</time>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <h1 id="notebook_is_going">Notebook is Going!</h1>

<p>The shocking news is that Google notebook is going tomorrow and do not have a replacement. Each notebook is going to be exported to Google Docs but the really strange thing is that when the export happens each of the notes looses the date and time that it was created. To my mind this is incredible. If I just wanted some text I would have kept it in a document in the fist place. Surely the whole point of a notebook is to record when you were thinking all of the small things!</p>

<p>In any case that is what is happening and so I need an alternative. It should do each of these things:</p>

<p>1) Support multiple notebooks - I need to keep some notes private and separate from others - personal stuff separate from work stuff for example. 1) Timestamp my notes - I want to create two or three notes a day each of which is time stamped. 1) Display the notes in a readable way. I want to be able to read my notes as a whole by scrolling from latest to oldest. 1) Import from Google notebook</p>

<p>While there are good alternatives out there I can not find one that does all four or most importantly the top three.</p>

<p>So far I have found:</p>

<h2 id="ubernote"><a href="(http://www.ubernote.com)">UberNote</a></h2>

<p>Has a nice simple interface but organises around tags not notebooks. This would be okay if there was a one click way to create a note with a particular tag (say from inside that tag’s view). The UberNote interface also has a prominent “all notes” at the top meaning there is far too much potential for private notes to get mixed up or displayed alongside less sensitive ones. There seems to be no import from Google notebook option.</p>

<p>UberNote does display the date for each note which is a plus.</p>

<h2 id="zoho_notebook"><a href="(http://notebook.zoho.com)">Zoho Notebook</a></h2>

<p>This looks most like Google notebook and has good readability, import from notebook and good Book separation and privacy. Just no date/times against the notes!</p>

<h2 id="evernote"><a href="(http://www.evernote.com)">Evernote</a></h2>

<p>Evernote has a nice professional look and good import from notebook. It’s separation into notebooks is passable but the privacy feel a little compromised by a prominent ‘all notes’ notebook. By far the worst thing about Evernote is the readability. It seems to be designed for a small number of large notes not a stream of smaller ones, and so while the stream of notes is visible it is not readable but rather compressed in tiny text down a thin column.</p>

<p>One really cool thing about evernote is that I can install the app on my phone, take a photo of a journal article and have evernote upload the photo as a note. This would be cool in itself but evernote can search the text in the photo! This makes it a really useful way of writing in the margins of other people’s books!</p>

<p>Evernote nearly made it to brilliant!</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>The sad conclusion is that there does not seem to be a useful alternative to Google Notebook. I have settled for Evernote but there is something quite unlikeable about the interface. A good layout should feel like it is not there. Evernote rather feels like the layout gets in the way of the actual notes and with every one I write I am aware that there is no export functionality and so I am getting tied in. Worse than all of that in the few days that I have been trying it I have lost important information. There is an auto-save feature but I suspect that if you move away from a note without either saving or waiting for the autosave to kick in, then the edit is silently lost. For me a notebook that looses your notes is not a good thing to be using. It’s like writing in a notebook and then turning back the page to discover that what you wrote has disappeared. In general the whole notion of needing to save a file is becoming quite last century. For a notebook the idea of save or loose it makes no sense at all.</p>
