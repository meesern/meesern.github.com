@article{Saurat2011Walking,
    abstract = {{To test if dreams contain remote or never-experienced motor skills, we collected during 6 weeks dream reports from 15 paraplegics and 15 healthy subjects. In 9/10 subjects with spinal cord injury and in 5/5 with congenital paraplegia, voluntary leg movements were reported during dream, including feelings of walking (46\%), running (8.6\%), dancing (8\%), standing up (6.3\%), bicycling (6.3\%), and practicing sports (skiing, playing basketball, swimming). Paraplegia patients experienced walking dreams (38.2\%) just as often as controls (28.7\%). There was no correlation between the frequency of walking dreams and the duration of paraplegia. In contrast, patients were rarely paraplegic in dreams. Subjects who had never walked or stopped walking 4–64 years prior to this study still experience walking in their dreams, suggesting that a cerebral walking program, either genetic or more probably developed via mirror neurons (activated when observing others performing an action) is reactivated during sleep.}},

The core challenge is to provide appropriate and consistent adaptive behaviours for these services in the face of huge volumes of sensor data exhibiting varying degrees of precision, accuracy and dynamism. Situation identification is an enabling technology that resolves noisy sensor data and abstracts it into higher-level concepts that are interesting to applications. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the nature and characteristics of situations, discuss the complexities of situation identification, and review the techniques that are most popularly used in modelling and inferring situations from sensor data. We compare and contrast these techniques, and conclude by identifying some of the open research opportunities in the area.}},

@article{Tosey2010Exploring,
    abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore a contemporary European development in research into first person accounts of experience, called psychophenomenology, that offers enhancements to phenomenological interviewing. It is a form of guided introspection that seeks to develop finely grained first-person accounts by using distinctions in language, internal sensory representations and imagery that have been incorporated from neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). It is also a participative, relational and developmental form of interviewing, in the sense that the interviewee can gain significant insight into their experience; the process is not concerned purely with data gathering. Design/methodology/approach - The authors review the theoretical assumptions on which psychophenomenology is based, then describe the principal method used in psychophenomenology, the 'explicitation interview'. The interview protocol is illustrated with transcript data, through which they identify specific aspects of NLP that have been incorporated into psychophenomenology. Findings - Psychophenomenology offers refinements to the precision of phenomenological methods found in organizational research, such as interpretative phenomenological analysis. Research limitations/implications - The epistemological claims and implications of psychophenomenology are reviewed. Practical implications - These developments may provide a basis for reconsidering the research value of introspection, which has often been dismissed as non-rigorous. Originality/value - The paper introduces psychophenomenology to the field of organizational research. It also describes how psychophenomenology has innovated by drawing from NLP, an approach to personal development that is found in organizational practices such as executive coaching, in order to enhance the precision and rigour of both interviews and transcript analysis.}},

Drawing on data from two longitudinal studies, student writing in the United Kingdom and professional academic writing in Hungary, Slovakia, Spain, and Portugal, the author illustrates the different contributions ethnography can make to researching academic writing, depending on the level at which it is construed, as method, methodology, or  ” deep theorizing.” In discussing the third level of ethnography, the author draws on recent debates around linguistic ethnography to explore how ethnography as deep theorizing can contribute to refining social practice accounts of academic writing through the specific notions of indexicality and orientation. By working through three levels of ethnography, her aim is to signal the ontological gap between text and context in academic writing research and to open up debate about how this gap can be narrowed.}},

    abstract = {{Focusing on the dehumanization of sexually objectified targets, study 1 tested the extent to which objectified and non-objectified male and female publicity photos were associated with human compared to animal concepts. Results confirmed the hypothesis that, among all targets, only objectified women were associated with less human concepts. This pattern of results emerged for both male and female participants but likely for different reasons. Study 2 directly looked at female and male participants' affinity with sexually objectified women. Results indicated that the more women distanced themselves from sexually objectified women the more they dehumanized them, whereas men's sexual attraction moderated their tendency to dehumanize female targets. In study 3, this latter motivation was operationalized as the activation of a sex goal and showed to trigger man's but not woman's dehumanization of female targets. Overall, the present set of studies show that only sexually objectified women are dehumanized by both men and women but for different reasons. Whereas sexual attraction shifts a men's focus of a female target away from her personality onto her body triggering a dehumanization process, women are more inclined to dehumanize their sexually objectified counterparts the more they distance themselves from these sexualized representations of their gender category.

    abstract = {{Objectives. To explore the nature and context of psychotic-like phenomena in clinical (C) and non-clinical (NC) participants, and to investigate whether the factors involved with triggering a psychotic-like 'out-of-the-ordinary' experience (OOE) can be distinguished from those determining its clinical consequences. Design and methods. Qualitative data were collected by semi-structured interviews, and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Twelve participants, who reported OOEs starting in the last 5 years, were split into C and NC groups depending on whether they were involved with mental-health services as a result of their experiences. Inter-group comparisons of emergent themes were made. Results. Inter-group similarities were found in the triggers and subjective nature of experiences, with clearer group differences in the inter-personal and background personal contexts, and how the experiences were incorporated into their lives. In particular, the inter-personal theme of validation was identified as important in distinguishing the clinical consequences of OOEs. Conclusions. It is not the OOE itself that determines the development of a clinical condition, but rather the wider personal and interpersonal contexts that influence how this experience is subsequently integrated.

@article{Soria2011Nonparametric,
    abstract = {{Many algorithms have been proposed for the machine learning task of classification. One of the simplest methods, the naive Bayes classifier, has often been found to give good performance despite the fact that its underlying assumptions (of independence and a normal distribution of the variables) are perhaps violated. In previous work, we applied naive Bayes and other standard algorithms to a breast cancer database from Nottingham City Hospital in which the variables are highly non-normal and found that the algorithm performed well when predicting a class that had been derived from the same data. However, when we then applied naive Bayes to predict an alternative clinical variable, it performed much worse than other techniques. This motivated us to propose an alternative method, based on naive Bayes, which removes the requirement for the variables to be normally distributed, but retains the essential structure and other underlying assumptions of the method. We tested our novel algorithm on our breast cancer data and on three UCI datasets which also exhibited strong violations of normality. We found our algorithm outperformed naive Bayes in all four cases and outperformed multinomial logistic regression (MLR) in two cases. We conclude that our method offers a competitive alternative to MLR and naive Bayes when dealing with data sets in which non-normal distributions are observed.}},

Four studies are reported, each demonstrating increased comprehension ratings and recall scores when Ss were supplied with appropriate information before they heard test passages. Supplying Ss with the same information subsequent to the passages produced much lower comprehension ratings and recall scores. Various explanations of the results are considered, and the role of topics in activating cognitive contexts is discussed.}},

@article{Tversky1974Judgment,
    abstract = {{This article described three heuristics that are employed in making judgements under uncertainty: (i) representativeness, which is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event A belongs to class or process B; (ii) availability of instances or scenarios, which is often employed when people are asked to assess the frequency of a class or the plausibility of a particular development; and (iii) adjustment from an anchor, which is usually employed in numerical prediction when a relevant value is available. These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgements and decisions in situations of uncertainty.}},

@article{Thibodeau2011Metaphors,
    abstract = {{The way we talk about complex and abstract ideas is suffused with metaphor. In five experiments, we explore how these metaphors influence the way that we reason about complex issues and forage for further information about them. We find that even the subtlest instantiation of a metaphor (via a single word) can have a powerful influence over how people attempt to solve social problems like crime and how they gather information to make  ” well-informed” decisions. Interestingly, we find that the influence of the metaphorical framing effect is covert: people do not recognize metaphors as influential in their decisions; instead they point to more  ” substantive” (often numerical) information as the motivation for their problem-solving decision. Metaphors in language appear to instantiate frame-consistent knowledge structures and invite structurally consistent inferences. Far from being mere rhetorical flourishes, metaphors have profound influences on how we conceptualize and act with respect to important societal issues. We find that exposure to even a single metaphor can induce substantial differences in opinion about how to solve social problems: differences that are larger, for example, than pre-existing differences in opinion between Democrats and Republicans.}},
