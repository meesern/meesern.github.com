The one question that occupies almost all human enquiry from scientific to religious and from personal relations to political philosophy is "What is the world like?"  Neither is the question restricted to explicit enquiry or in fact to human thought.  It is the quesion that a great deal of mamalian brain exists in order to dynamically approximate an answer to.

The quality of the answers we derive affect all corners of human experience from our ability to build GigaHertz computer processors to our abilty to maintain meaningful relationships.  Scientific enquiry, religion, folk law and intuition are all methods of addessing the question over various domains.  Metaphysics even attempts to understand what a world populated by beings attempting to discover what the world is like, is like.

Once, sat around a campfire on a freezing winter night, I met a man who lived in a van.  His belief was that we all carried with us part of 'the answer'.  It was, he said, our duty to share our part to the best of our ability.  When I asked him what that part might be like he said it could take any form - for someone it might be a dance or a poem, for someone else it might just be somethin they know.  If we all came together, he said, and shared our part, then it would form a whole and we would all have the answer.  When I asked him what his part was, he gave me his hand drawn leaflet and said that this was it - to share that idea that we should all share our part.  Perhaps he was right. In any case what follows is (the second part) of my part.
