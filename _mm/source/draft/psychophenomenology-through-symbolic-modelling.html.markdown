A conjecture
=============

That there exists a mechanism through which personal and subjective experience can 

* There exists an understanding which promises to reconcile the art/science divide and lead to new ways of performing calculations that are more organic.

* Perception and meaning making when examined from a phenomenological perspective can lead to 

* Differentiating subjective experience through reflexive psychophenomenology can lead to better modelling of the act of modelling. 


Metaphor
--------

Maths: defines relationships.

Science: Conjecture -> hypothesis -> theory.  Science is a process of validation but neglects the modelling nature of theory making.

Science becomes bound by slavish application of rules.

Social science: Original soft science adopted modelling but was 'unempirical' the domain of applicability was unexamined.  Attempts to do 'real' science robbed social science of its relevance by restricting the domain.

Science of subjectivity:  Using self as laboratory.  Could require good and skilled lab technicians.

If this ... then what would happen ...?


Some ifs have more validity that others and the hypothetical whole universe problem might be interesting.


Allowing rational subjectivity (or model  allows theories like money as gratitude to be more easily formulated and explored.

Wilhelm Dilthey distinguishes natural and human sciences by the 'methodological difference between explanation and understanding.'
