Here's the video of a project called 'The Experiement' that I was involved with.  You can just spot me in the background in the control room.

In the post production meeting we got to talking about meaning in the physiological data and I said that with my NLP and Symbolic Modelling training I was able to conversationally elicit emotional states in willing volunteers.  

Emotions research is a bit of a mess with several semi-conflicting schemes to attempt to catalogue ‘basic emotions’.  I’m not surprised – it’s a classic hallmark of  mismodelling (like imagining everything is made of earth, air, fire and water then getting confusing results).   Here are two classifications of basic emotions from two different models.

Sadness, Happiness, Disgust, Anxiety, Anger.
Or
Fear, Anger, Joy, Sadness, Acceptance, Disgust, Expectancy and Surprise

I think much of the confusion comes from a misapplication of reductionist world view.  It presents the idea that there are discrete things called ‘emotions’ out in the real world (in this case a body) that can be sensed by a ‘person’ (meaning a thinking mind).    This matches the metaphors that we routinely use for emotion: that we ‘feel’ fear much as one might feel a teacup.   I am not sure what is meant by a ‘basic’ emotion.  It is not something I am aware of outside of academic attempts at classification.  In my experience people have emotions that they are comfortable naming and those that they are less able too.  There are only limited reasons why this should relate to a notion of basic that means ‘atomic’ or ‘universal’ or ‘definable’.   A more sophisticated model would be informed by the following:  that emotion is derived from what Korzybski in 1933 called a semantic response-  it is a product of meaning making.  An aspect of any semantic response is physiological (release of hormones, vascular control, ideomotor responses, postural responses etc.); Awareness of felt sense comes from changes against habituated conditions.  The identification and naming  of a felt sense as an emotion is a (phenomenological) act of construction.  Naming is strongly influenced by (micro) culture – where anger to one person is rage to another and anger to a third is annoyance to a fourth.  There can be no overriding ‘correct and precise’ definition of anger (for example) because in a very real sense it can only mean what a person means by it.  This is true to an extent of anything named, of course.  A cup is only a cup if we say  it is, but the probability density cloud of consensus for an emotion (or a cup for that matter) does not reveal a single precise thing in the external world. 

I get really interested in these kinds of things because it happens all the time that unsophisticated models give good results only within a range of applicability.  The confusion often seems to come from mistaking the model for ‘the real world’ (which is the same as not being able to think outside the model).  It’s human nature to make profligate and mediocre models of the world (and necessary because most of the time it’s all we are capable of).  I think it gets particularly interesting in science because it’s trackable in some way.  Models such as ‘basic emotions’ are clearly useful but how does one work with the limits of applicability of the model?

It seems to me that by eliciting emotions and measuring biodata we have a chance to reveal structure in a way that can’t happen when fitting data to a model.
