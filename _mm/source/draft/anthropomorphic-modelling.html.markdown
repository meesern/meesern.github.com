Thoughts
========

Lost my phone and so used old digital watch as alarm.  Time still set to British Summer time.  Fiddly to change so set the alarm for 7am meaning 6am.  Alarm went off at 6am but I was very sleepy that morning and unable to wake up.  Slept another hour.  Glimpsed the simple machinery.  We are more predictable than we like to think - Derren Brown.

Temporal lobe (check) exists to inhibit action and so do planning and 'as if'.  In modelling others perhaps we anthropomorphisize others in order to model behaviour and perhaps we do the same with ourselves.

We could develop anthropomorphic software systems.  They structure is this...
Do a simple thing behind a rich and soft set of behaviours that can respond to multiple input directions.  E.g.  Tiredness is rich and soft and can be driven by not enough sleep or being unwell or boredom etc.  We mis-model complexity.

An hint for a software system would be displaying more future road on the sat-nav by allowing the orientation to tilt within bounds.
