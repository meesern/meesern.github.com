With the imminent decline in available energy that accompanies passing the planet's peak capacity to produce oil comes the demise of the age of convenience.

Thank goodness, whatever troubles post peak oil may also bring we should celebrate that at least.

Convenience infantilizes us.
Convenience makes us powerless/victims.
It robs us of individuality.

Like a super-stimulus, like a seagull sitting on a volley ball.
